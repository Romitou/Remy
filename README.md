# üêÄ R√©my

R√©my *(from the movie Ratatouille)* is a Discord bot offering its users a modern way to receive notifications when a table becomes available in the restaurants of Disneyland Paris parks and hotels.
Using the [DisneyTables](https://github.com/Romitou/DisneyTables) project specially created for this purpose, users can manage their alerts via the bot and receive messages when a notification is generated by DisneyTables.
